# Nested Fluid Grid System

This system is based on davist11's [nested-responsive-grid](http://davist11.github.io/nested-responsive-grid/). As most basic grid systems, this one relies on utility classes in the markup. Unlike most grid systems of this sort, you can set data-attributes for some nifty responsive adjustments.

*This system is written as a basic LESS mixin.*

## Features include
- The ability to set column count and gutter size.
- The ability to adjust column spans by named breakpoints via data-attributes.
